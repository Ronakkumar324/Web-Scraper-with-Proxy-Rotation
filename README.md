# 🕷️ Web-Scraper-with-Proxy-Rotation

**📌 Synopsis:** This project develops an Amazon web scraper to automate the extraction of key product details such as titles, prices, ratings, reviews, and availability. Web scraping is an essential technique in e-commerce analytics, providing insights into market trends and competitive intelligence.


**🎯 Objective:** To design a reliable and efficient web scraper for Amazon that automates data extraction while adhering to ethical and legal guidelines. The collected data will be used for price comparison, trend analysis, and business intelligence.


**🧰 Methodology:** The scraper is built using Python, employing libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Scrapy for parsing HTML content. Selenium is incorporated to handle dynamic content and JavaScript-based elements. Proxy rotation and user-agent switching techniques enhance anonymity and prevent detection. Extracted data is structured and stored in a database for easy querying and analysis.


**🎯 Expected Outcome**: A robust web scraping solution capable of efficiently extracting and structuring Amazon product data.
🧠 The scraper will provide accurate insights into:

1. 💲 Pricing trends

2. 👥 Customer preferences

3. 📈 Market competition

This facilitates smarter, data-driven decision-making.


**📊 Impact:** This project lays a strong foundation for data-driven decision-making in e-commerce, benefiting both businesses and consumers.

1. 🏷️ Helps businesses optimize pricing strategies

2. 📦 Improves inventory management

3. 🛍️ Empowers consumers to make informed purchase decisions

4. 🤖 Future upgrades include ML-based price prediction and sentiment analysis to boost analytical capabilities


**🔮 Future Enhancements**
1. Integrate ML models for price prediction

2. Perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews

3. Add a dashboard for visualizing scraped data

4. Enable cloud storage or API-based scraping


**🧪 Testing**
1. Test proxy rotation with dummy endpoints

2. Validate HTML selectors with static Amazon product pages

3. Compare outputs with manually collected data
