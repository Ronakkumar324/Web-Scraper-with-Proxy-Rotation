**Synopsis:** This project develops an Amazon web scraper to automate the extraction of key product details such as titles, prices, ratings, reviews, and availability. Web scraping is an essential technique in e-commerce analytics, providing insights into market trends and competitive intelligence.

**Objective:** To design a reliable and efficient web scraper for Amazon that automates data extraction while adhering to ethical and legal guidelines. The collected data will be used for price comparison, trend analysis, and business intelligence.
